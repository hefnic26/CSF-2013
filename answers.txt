Homework 3/4 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:



Problem 2:

0.43029262963

Problem 3:

The reason the "linenum" and "seq" lines do not work if you comment them out is because it doesn't define those functions in the program and therefore python doesn't know what it's supposed to do when it later encoutners those variables in the program.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.3
AT-content: 0.7

Reflection:

Oh my goodness!  This was incredibly easy once I got over the fear of just being so wrong for so long.  I had really paniced because I didn't do it for so long and I thought I was going to be impossibly behind; I'm disappointed in myself and I'm sorry I did that.  I feel like I've had the hardest time in this thread of the class unfortunately.

Reflection/Collaboration:

Sam Stubbins stusam07 helped me get through the latter part of homework4.  I had trouble running my dna_analysis for some time because I had moved the file into a different folder and it was just all sorts of messed up and perpelexing for a good while there.  I am happy to be more caught up then I was and I found it helpful to learn how to run a python script from command line.  It gave me a better understanding of how it works.
