# You may do your work by editing this file, or by typing code at the
# command line and copying it into the appropriate part of this file when
# you are done.  When you are done, running this file should compute and
# print the answers to all the problems.


###
### Problem 1
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 1 solution follows:"

# Solution to Guass' problem
a = 0
b = 0
while a < 100:
    a +=1
    b += a
    print b

###
### Problem 2
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 2 solution follows:"

#though I got the correct answer, I feel as though there should be
#a more simplified way of writing this code.

numbers=[1/2.0, 1/3.0, 1/4.0, 1/5.0, 1/6.0, 1/7.0, 1/8.0, 1/9.0, 1/10.0]
for num in numbers:
    print num

###
### Problem 3
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 3 solution follows:"


n = 10
triangular = 0
for i in range(n):
    triangular=(i*n)/2*n
print "Triangular number", n, "via loop:", triangular
print "Triangular number", n, "via formula:", n*(n+1)/2

###
### Problem 4
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 4 solution follows:"

n = 10
factorial = 1
for i in range(n):
    factorial = factorial*(i+1)
    print factorial

###
### Problem 5
###

print "Problem 5 solution follows:"

# I needed quite a bit of help figuring out nested for loops.  I'm still not quite able to lucidly explain why this works.

n = 10
factorial = 1
for i in range(1, n+1):
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        factorial = factorial*i
    print factorial
    factorial=1
    n=n-1        

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 6 solution follows:"

# after having looked through a few other people's code; I realize I truly don't understand this problem,
# so I will just work on it during the next tutoring session I go to.

### Reflection
###

###  This homework took an insanely long time, I'd say in the neighbrohood of 10+ hours, Sam and I spent around 3 hours
### just going through problem 1.  This is definitely due to my lack of math skills and having been out of any higher level
### math environment for more than 10 years.  However, learning the commands isn't terribly difficult, it's simply trying to implement them
### mathmatically that is the challenge for me.  It seems like I just haphazardly stumbled upon the answer and wouldn't have got there without a great deal of collaboration.
